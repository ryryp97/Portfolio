# Portfolio

This repository is an About Me website which also contains a portfolio of web projects that I have worked on as well as personal contact information.

The site can be reached here: [Portfolio](https://ryryp97.github.io/Portfolio/)

## Usage

The links in the navigation bar direct to different webpages of the website when clicked on (contact will direct to a page that allows inputs, portfolio directs to a page with photos of me and my family, projects directs to a page with websites I have made, and about directs to the home page).

## Credits

I'd like to thank the documentation guides on the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/) website, they were a big help in the proper utilization of Bootstrap.
